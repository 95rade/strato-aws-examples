# AWS SDK example
This example utilizes the standard aws sdk with symphony.
Best to run it from an IDE, but in anycase, the it's the code example itself that matters

## Prerequisites
1. Make sure you have jre/jdk installed.
2. Make sure you have gradle installed on your system

## Run
1. gradle clean build
2. java -jar <path to jar file, located in ./build/lib/>

## SSL Verification
By default, Symphony arrives with self signed certificates. In order to avoid SSL verification, add 
-Dcom.amazonaws.sdk.disableCertChecking to your JVM parameters.
